#AdvancedSubclassing is a subclass manager for SCP: SL. It allows you to make and manage subclasses with no coding knowledge.

I am always looking for ability suggestions, message me on discord, or make a new [issue](https://github.com/steven4547466/AdvancedSubclassing/issues/new)!

The latest stable release can be found [here](https://github.com/steven4547466/AdvancedSubclassing/releases/latest). This plugin requires EXILED to run, you can find more [here](https://github.com/galaxy119/EXILED).

# This plugin is a little complicated, so it has a [wiki](https://github.com/steven4547466/AdvancedSubclassing/wiki)!

Here's a small example of what's possible: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMJ22G308p4

# Development Boards:
As of September 9th, 2020, I will start using a [GitKraken Board](https://app.gitkraken.com/glo/board/X2TFPCQxbQAR8KyS) as a roadmap and tracker. Stuff before that date is not tracked there.

# 939 thing because I know it'll get asked
939 visuals don't make other players go invisible anymore when you aren't 939, I'm going to dig through the base game code to see if I can do anything about it, but I'm not sure if this is something I can fix. If I can't the 939 visuals ability will be maked obsolete.
